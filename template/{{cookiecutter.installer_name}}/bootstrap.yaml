  # You can discard defaults if you would rather use Python builds from Conda
  # Forge. In turn, you can discard conda-forge if you don't care about Conda's
  # C/C++ toolchain and trust the native one.
  - defaults
  - conda-forge

dependencies:
  # These are essential! Edit {{cookiecutter.installer_name}}/python_version to
  # change the Python version.
  - python={python_version}
  - pip
  - setuptools
  - setuptools-rust
  - wheel

  # Optional, if you don't want to rely on the native C/C++ toolchain deployed
  # on the machine where the installer is produced (in principle, no C/C++
  # toolchain is needed on the installation target machines).
  - compilers
